/**
 * This class defines the basic interface for any genetic algorithm to be defined.
 * The population is formed by Individuals (the reason why it's been done like this
 * is so we can experiment with different individuals and different fitness functions
 * easily). There is a CrossoverType object contained within this class to make it
 * easy to use different crossover techniques through the use of polymorphism.
 *
 * Currently the derived classes are responsible for choosing the type of individual
 * that they are going to used, but this is going to be changed in future versions
 * (so we can create a genetic algorithm selecting size of population, generations,
 * number of matches per bot, crossover technique, individual/size of chromosome,
 * fitness technique) to be more flexible.
